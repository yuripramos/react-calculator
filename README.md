## :octocat: Getting Started

This project was made focusing on the architecture of high scalable projects. The App itself is small but is 100% ready to get as big as possible

:heavy_check_mark: Cross-Browser Solution! (even for MS Edge)

Made with :heart: and Redux-zero.

## :fire: Why Redux-zero as a state manager?

[Redux-zero](https://github.com/redux-zero/redux-zero) is a lightweight state container based on Redux.
I would like to share 3 arguments to choose redux-zero over redux.

1. Is lighter(less than 1kb) than redux and in projects that are not necessarily high usage of reducers, it helps to focus on what is important.
2. I participated in the conception of this lib, made mostly by an ex-coworker.
3. I'm currently focusing my career in leadership and share knowledge that I've learned across these years, so would be
   an honor gives a presentation about this amazing library.

## :fire: Why Reverse Proxy?

Due to security issues of [DarkskyAPI](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/faq#cross-origin) they throw CORS error from localhost, so it's necessary to work around this. To avoid wasting time setting-up a node+express reverse proxy server in cases like that I use this reverse proxy [service](https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch). (not accessible link)

## :cloud: Installation

Makefiles aren't Windows friendly, if you have minGW64 and whole environment to run the makefile(Unix/macOS) do this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yuripramos/forecast-app
cd forecast-app
make installation
make build
make start-server
access http://localhost:3000
Search your desired city =)
```

If you **don't** have makefile enviroment ready, do this instead :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yuripramos/forecast-app
cd forecast-app
npm install or yarn install
npm run build
npm run start:server
access http://localhost:3000
Search your desired city =)
```

**Requires node >= 8.9.3**
