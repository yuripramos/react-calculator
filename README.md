## :octocat: Getting Started

As we discussed during this morning I'm making available the whole content of my bootstrap but the calculator itself is located in `./src/components/Calculator`.

## :cloud: Installation

Makefiles aren't Windows friendly, if you have minGW64 and whole environment to run the makefile(Unix/macOS) do this:

```sh
make installation
make build
make start-server
access http://localhost:3000/calc
navigate through menu links at the header
```

If you **don't** have makefile enviroment ready, do this instead :

```sh

npm install or yarn install
npm run build
npm run start:server
access http://localhost:3000/calc
navigate through menu links at the header
```

**Requires node >= 8.9.3**

## development env?

```sh
npm install or yarn install
npm run dev
access http://localhost:3000/calc
navigate through menu links at the header
```
